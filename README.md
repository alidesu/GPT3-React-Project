# GPT3-React-Project
 
This is my first React.JS project. I created this to learn the real time implementation of React.JS and how it is integrated with standard HTML, CSS and JS website.

Live Version: https://gpt3clonereact.netlify.app/

I have included my compiled code with Raw project code files. I didn't included the 'node modulues' due to its ridiculously large size.
'build' file contains the compiled code. 'dumpedCode.rar' contains zipped ReactJS project. While all other files are raw files for project.
